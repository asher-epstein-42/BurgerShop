# BurgerShop
Burger shop app for costumes and workers using MONGODB (pymongo)

Every user needs to register by setting his name, email, password and address. To use his account, he needs to log in with his email and password. A user can order a meal, add a review and change his address in the database. A worker can see the orders, delete finished ones by their id, see the reviews and register a new worker(only a sign in worker can register a new worker).



Bon appetit!
